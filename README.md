# ✈️ EventfulTravelApp ✈️

An interactive travel recommendation prototype built with **Streamlit**. This app is for people who have time to travel but not sure where exactly to go. To overcome this issue, this app helps users find travel destinations based on their personal "vibe," interests, and budget, while pulling real-time event data from the **Ticketmaster API**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smart Recommendations:** Suggests cities like Ghent, Barcelona, or Paris based on user preferences.
- **Live Events:** Integrates with the Ticketmaster Discovery API to show actual concerts and events in the recommended city.
- **Budget Prediction:** Uses a heuristic logic to estimate flight and activity costs, comparing them against the user's set budget.
- **Aesthetic UI:** Custom CSS-styled cards for a modern look and feel.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Streamlit**: For the web interface and interactivity.
- **Python**: Core logic and data processing.
- **Ticketmaster API**: For live event data.
